            <h2>Your Mood History</h2>
It's important to recognize how you've been feeling. Mood can changes from day to day and it's totally normal! It is
great if you feel positive overall, but it is also okay if you feel negative. Feel free to reach out to friends and
family, and the social workers who will listen and care for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a mood tracker that shows how you feel in the past month. From the graph, can you tell are you feeling overall
        positive or negative?

We take a positive emotion as a +1 score, and a negative emotion as a -1 score. For each day, we sum up your responses
in your daily reflection. For example. you answer, "happy"(+1), "angry"(-1) and "focus"(+1), so your score will be sum
to +1

                <br><h2>Monthly Mood Tracker</h2>

                We also gather all of the emotions you told me in your daily reflection for the past month, and display it in a word
                cloud. The bigger the text, the more often you were feeling in that way. From the graph, can you tell what are your most
                common emotions?
