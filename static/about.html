    <div class="about">
<p class="left-align">This app was designed with kids in mind. The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on mental
    health, particularly on that of young people. According to a national survey, children generally experience twice as
    much anxiety, loneliness and stress than before the pandemic. Because they are required to take online school
    lessons at home, they experience a lack of physical social interactions with their peers, and the resources to help
    them cope with their feelings and emotions. Therefore, Egao (“smiley face” in Japanese) was created to help ease the
    mind for children and cope with their mental health issues. </p>
<p class="left-align"> Egao is a fun online platform for children to recognize and track their own emotions. We also
    introduce various games on Egao to help them cope with issues such as difficulty to focus, anxiety and stress. We
    focus on children from the ages 6 to 14, who we think may need the most help. </p>
<p class="left-align">We hope to improve the app over time and provide statistics to teachers and social workers where
    they can track the students' progress. Parents would also be able to see what their children's mood is like and
    offer extra care and attention.</p>
